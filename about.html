        Hi! I'm Carl Carlson, when I was young I was often bullied by other
        foodies, because of my strong desire for wild boar meat, until Lenny
        Leonard, to help my courage, induced me to drink some of the magic
        potion that made the villagers Michelin Star Chefs. When we were
        interrupted in the act, I fell into the cauldron containing the potion,
        and drank it all, and since then I'm permanently under its influence. As
        a consequence of this accident, I developed phenomenal cooking skills.
        Now I'm sharing my exceptional skills and outstanding recipes with
        others on my personal Food Blog!
        <br />
